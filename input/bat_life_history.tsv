Levi	Lasionycteris_noctivagans	Silver-haired bat	Chiroptera	Vespertilionidae	NorthAmerica	Canada_USA	0	migratory	migratory	long-distance migrant	1500 km in Long Point, Ontario (McGuire et al. 2011 Journal of Animal Ecology); 38 to 2,774 km across North American range (Fraser et al. 2017 Journal of Mammalogy)	Thought to mate in fall and store sperm over winter, delaying fertilization and birth until post-migration in spring. However, recent mating observation during spring migratory period (Clerc et al 2022 Western North American Naturalist)	Some populations are year-round residents except at northern latitudes and high altitudes, Fraser et al. found evidence for partial migration in some populations (i.e., migration is facultative)

They are believed to migrate through Florida from late October to late November and from February through early May. Autumn migration occurs in waves, whereas spring migration appears to be less organized. Some hoary bats are believed to remain in the north and hibernate for the winter, rather than moving south of the United States like most do." (Anderson 2002)	-thought to mate around the time of autumn migration. Researchers are uncertain about whether copulation occurs before, during, or after the southward migration... Mating may also occur at southern wintering grounds. (Anderson 2002) -delayed fertilization, sperm stored over winter for spring fertilization	
Alicia	Miniopterus_schreibersii	Common bent-wing bat	Chiroptera	Vespertilionidae	Europe	Spain	0	migratory	non-migratory	regional migrant	-The average distance between summer and winter roots can range from 40 to 100km but longer distances have been recorded. -can migrate multiple times a year depending on the weather conditions	-Mating took place in the fall (late May to early June), with fertilization and development to the blastocyst stage immediately following. Implantation was delayed until August and births occurred in December. Each female usually has one offspring (Nowak, 1997).	
Alicia	Myotis_blythii	Lesser mouse-eared bat	Chiroptera	Vespertilionidae	Europe	France	0	non-migratory	non-migratory	non-migratory	-This species is considered an occasional migrant due to a few recorded distances of 100 - 150 km. More often than not, it has a sedentary behaviour and its summer an winter roosts are usually 15 km apart. (eurobats.org) -These bats don’t make long dislocations, they are non-migratory or occasionally migrant species. (batmonitoring.org)	-The males of this specie usually are not living in colonies or they form small groups near the main maternity colony. The pups are born in the end of May until mid-June. Usually only one pup is born, and it start to fly after 5 or 6 weeks. (batmonitoring.org)	
Alicia	Myotis_daubentonii	Daubenton's bat	Chiroptera	Vespertilionidae	Europe	Finland	0	migratory	non-migratory	regional migrant	-considered non-migratory but will move ¢. 150 - 304 km from maternity roosts to hibernation sites (gbif.org) -large numbers of individuals converge to mate after traveling up to 30 km -Individuals from lowland regions are assumed to move longer distances than those roosting in high mountains. Especially in the north-eastern part ofits distribution, they congregate in winter in large numbers (e. g. 20,000 in Nietoperek, Poland or up to 5000 individuals in Berlin, Germany) (gbif.org)	-Nursery colonies are formed in the summer and they comprise of 20 – 50 females. The males form small separate colonies. The copulation is from fall to spring. The summer roosts in tree holes are changed every 2 – 5 days. The female gives birth to one pup. (batslife.eu) -During mating in September — November (particularly intense in October-November), they are most commonly found at swarming sites (e. g. caves, mines, or buildings) where large numbers of individuals converge to mate after traveling up to 30 km. Maximum reported longevity is c. 4 years, butit is assumed it can live longer similar to some congeners.Within three weeks the young start to fly and after 4 – 6 weeks they are independent. This species lives up to 20 years. (gbif.org)

Alicia	Myotis_thysanodes	Fringed myotis	Chiroptera	Vespertilionidae	NorthAmerica	Canada_USA	0	migratory	non-migratory	regional migrant	-highly migratory (animaldiversity,.org) -Fringed bats are known to migrate, but little is known about the magnitude of movements. (iucnredlist.org) -Scant information on hibernating sites suggests this species may migrate only short distances to cave hibernation sites (env.gov.bc.ca) -"The migratory patterns of Myotis thysanodes are  not well known. They do maintain constant, low levels of body fat throughout the spring and summer and put on additional fat rapidly in late summer and early fall, suggesting that colonies migrate to winter hibernacula (Wilson and Ruff 1999). It is not known how far these hibernacula are from breeding grounds, but the distance is not likely to be great given the generally slow, maneuverable, energetically demanding flight of this species. It is therefore likely that M. thysanodes spend  both summer and winter on National Forest System lands in Region 2. On a small scale in their northern range (e.g., South Dakota, Wyoming, and northern Colorado)(P. Brown unpublished data)" (Keinath 2004) -In the temperate portion of its range, Myotis thysanodes likely migrates short distances to winter hibernacula that are lower in elevation and/or more southern than summer roosts. In southern desert areas,  bats may actually move to higher elevations in search of cooler temperatures for hibernation. (Keinath 2004)	-a single young is born in late June or early July. Males and females usually do not associate with one another during summer months and males are not normally found within the maternity roosts. The colonies have usually dispersed by the end of October. (animaldiversity.org)
